<html><body><h1>File Summary</h1><p>"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving is a tale found among the papers of Diedrich Knickerbocker. Set in a sleepy, secluded New York village called Sleepy Hollow, the story revolves around Ichabod Crane, a lanky and superstitious schoolteacher from Connecticut who is enamored with local beauty Katrina Van Tassel. Sleepy Hollow is notorious for its ghost stories, especially that of the Headless Horseman, the ghost of a Hessian trooper. Ichabod competes with Brom Bones, a local tough, for Katrina’s affection. On the way home from a party at the Van Tassels', Ichabod encounters the ghostly Horseman, leading to his mysterious disappearance. Although a rumor suggests Ichabod later fled due to embarrassment and became a magistrate elsewhere, the townspeople largely believe he was spirited away by the supernatural. Brom Bones marries Katrina, often laughs at the mention of a pumpkin—hinting at a prank he may have played on Ichabod. The tale becomes a local legend often retold in the community.</p><br><h1>Key Words</h1><p>['ichabod', 'sleepy', 'hollow', 'local', 'legend', 'tale', 'katrina', 'van', 'ghost', 'horseman']</p></body></html>
